# Napplet Boilerplate Agent Guide

This repository is a starter for one NIP-5D napplet. Keep it small,
framework-light, and centered on the napplet side of the shell boundary.

## Before Editing

1. Read `docs/context-map.md`.
2. Read the boundary document for the surface you are changing:
   - `docs/boundaries.md`
   - `docs/design-patterns.md`
   - `docs/package-surfaces.md`
3. If changing protocol assumptions, verify against the pinned NIP-5D reference
   in `docs/nip-5d.md`.
4. If the change appears to need a new NAP name, message domain, or numbered
   wire format, read `docs/new-nap-proposals.md` before writing code.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not add shell implementation code to this template.
- Do not access signer keys, relay pools, cookies, service workers, or host DOM
  directly from napplet code.
- Do not use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for durable app state. Use
  `@napplet/sdk` storage helpers.
- Do not use direct `fetch`, `WebSocket`, or `EventSource` unless the code first
  checks NAP-CONNECT grant state and the origin is declared in `vite.config.ts`.
- Prefer `resource.bytes()` for read-only external bytes.
- Import `@napplet/shim` once at the app entry point before calling SDK helpers.
- Do not invent app-local NAP names, numbers, or JSON envelope domains. Open a
  proposal PR to `napplet/naps` only after the guardrails in
  `docs/new-nap-proposals.md` are satisfied.

## Verification

Run these before claiming completion:

```bash
pnpm type-check
pnpm build
```

Use `pnpm dev` for shell/manual testing. A passing browser smoke test should
cover iframe load, shell capability display, and at least one user-triggered SDK
operation in the target shell.
