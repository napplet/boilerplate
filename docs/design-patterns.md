# Napplet Design Patterns

## Bootstrap

The runtime injects `window.napplet` before app code runs. Use SDK helpers in
napplet code.

```ts
import { outbox, storage, identity } from '@napplet/sdk';
```

SDK methods read `window.napplet` at call time. This lets app modules import SDK
helpers freely while preserving runtime-owned injection.

## Feature Detection

Use injected domain property presence for optional surfaces.

```ts
const supportsResource = Boolean(window.napplet?.resource);
const supportsOutbox = Boolean(window.napplet?.outbox);
```

Support checks are advisory. A user-triggered call can still fail because the
shell denied a grant, disconnected a signer, hit a quota, or rejected a policy
input. Always surface operation errors.

## Storage

Use storage for durable app state.

```ts
await storage.setItem('draft', value);
const value = await storage.getItem('draft');
```

Storage is scoped by napplet identity and aggregate hash on the shell side.
Do not add browser storage fallbacks without a deliberate privacy review.

## Configuration Schema Gap

The living [NAP-CONFIG proposal](https://github.com/napplet/naps/pull/14)
defines runtime `config.registerSchema`, but it does not currently define a
manifest tag or HTML-meta encoding for build-time schemas. This starter does not
use vite-plugin `configSchema`; do not treat its private `config` tag or
`napplet-config-schema` meta as interoperable protocol. Recheck the living
proposal before adding settings.

## Applet Layout

A napplet is framed by a runtime that already shows its name, so the starter
renders no title header, tagline, or masthead. The layout is compact and fills
the frame at any size: `#app` is a `container-type: inline-size` grid, the
toolbar goes icon-only below 240px, the draft and output panes sit side by side
from 480px, and the wide tier (≥ 900px) gives the editor and output more room
instead of centering a column. Short frames hide the informational domain
strip. The runtime theme repaints `--bg`, `--fg`, and `--primary`, and every
other token derives from them, so `html`, `body`, and `#app` always match the
host in dark and light themes.

Keep those properties when replacing the demo. Add a minimum size (with a
short notice below it) only when the product genuinely cannot work smaller.
The `napplet-ui` skill carries the full contract and the four-frame check.

## Text Selection

The starter treats the napplet surface like app chrome: static text does not
show accidental selection highlights by default. The default is plain CSS in
`src/styles.css`, not a shell or protocol rule.

Use one of these app-local overrides when copy/select behavior is part of the
napplet UX:

```html
<pre data-napplet-select="text">copyable output</pre>
<code data-napplet-select="all">nostr:...</code>
```

For a text-heavy napplet, set the root variable instead:

```css
:root {
  --napplet-text-selection: text;
}
```

## OUTBOX-First Nostr Access

Use OUTBOX for normal social event reads and publishes so the runtime owns relay
discovery, fallback, deduplication, signing, and fanout.

```ts
const { events } = await outbox.query([{ kinds: [1], limit: 5 }]);
const sub = outbox.subscribe([{ kinds: [1], limit: 20 }]);
sub.on('event', (result) => renderEvent(result.event));
sub.close();
```

Keep subscriptions tied to UI lifecycle and close them on teardown.

## Relay-Local Escape Hatch

Use RELAY only when the feature needs semantics tied to one named relay, such as
a NIP-29 group relay, raw relay diagnostics, or protocol tooling OUTBOX cannot
express. Document that reason next to the call.

```ts
import { relay } from '@napplet/sdk';

const sub = relay.subscribe(
  [{ kinds: [9, 10, 11, 12], limit: 50 }],
  (result) => renderGroupEvent(result.event),
  () => markCaughtUp(),
  { relay: 'wss://groups.example.com' },
);
sub.close();
```

## Resource Fetching

Use `resource.bytes()` for external read-only bytes. The shell applies its
resource policy before bytes reach the iframe.

```ts
const blob = await resource.bytes('https://example.com/avatar.png');
```

For images, prefer `bytesAsObjectURL()` and revoke the handle when the element is
done using it.

## Deferred NAPs (direct network access, security class)

NAP-CONNECT direct-network grants and NAP-CLASS shell-assigned security posture
are currently **deferred** on the [NAPs track](https://github.com/napplet/naps).
They are not part of the active surface: the `connect`/`class` domains, their
SDK helpers, and the vite-plugin `connect` option have been removed. Do not
depend on them. For read-only external bytes, use `resource.bytes()`. If your
napplet genuinely needs a capability the active NAPs do not cover, propose it on
the track first (see below) rather than reaching for removed surface.

## Missing Protocol Surface

Do not create a new JSON envelope domain in app code when a named NAP interface
or numbered wire format is missing. First check whether existing NAPs can be
composed. If the feature really needs a reusable shell-mediated contract, follow
`docs/new-nap-proposals.md` and open a focused PR to
`https://github.com/napplet/naps`.
